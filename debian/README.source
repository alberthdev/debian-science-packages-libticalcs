libticalcs2 for Debian
----------------------

ROM dumpers, i.e. precompiled firmware has been removed from the
upstream sources in all the 'src/rom[0-9]*.h' files.

The Z80 ROM dumpers (ti73 - ti86) are built using spasm, which is not
packaged for Debian.
The 68k ROM dumpers (ti89 - v200) are built using tigcc/gcc4ti, which
is also free software, but not packaged for Debian either.
